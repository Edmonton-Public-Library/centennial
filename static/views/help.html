<h2><a id="timemap"></a>1. TimeMap</h2>

<h3><a id="accounts"></a>What is the TimeMap?</h3>
<p> The TimeMap is an interactive timeline and map of the city of Edmonton created for the EPL
Centennial celebration. Through this application you are able to explore the history of the
city as it relates to the Public Library system.

We have populated the timemap with numerous stories, but it is up to you to enlarge this collection.
By creating an account you will be able to contribute to this project. We encourage everyone to submit
their stories so that they can be shared with the whole world.
</p>

<h3><a id="navigation"></a>Navigation</h3>
<p>TimeMap navigation is built to be simple and intuitive. By using the
timeline, you can navigate backwards and forwards in time. As you do so, the view
of the map will automatically be updated to represent the branches as they existed
in the time range selected by the time selector.
To navigate backwards or forwards in time:
<ol>
    <li>Place your mouse cursor over the timeline widget.</li>
    <li>Click and drag the timeline to the right or to the left until the desired decade is selected in the time selector.</li>
</ol>
As you drag the timeline, the map view will automatically change from the Google
maps view to maps of Edmonton for the time period currently selected by the time selector.<br>
</p>

<h3><a id="viewing_branches"></a>Viewing Branches</h3>

<h2><a id="accounts"></a></a>2. Accounts</h2>

<p>An account is <i>not</i> required to view content on the TimeMap website. An account is required only if a user wants to upload their own content to the TimeMap website. Accounts are free.</p>

	<li>If the username has already been taken by another user, an error message is displayed. Unfortunately, usernames must be unique. The user must choose another username for their account.</li>

This email contains a link that the user must follow to validate their account. The user will only be able to login to the TimeMap website once they have verified their email address.
</p>

<p>A user can login to their account by clicking on the "Account" button in the top right corner of any screen. A dialog box appears, allowing the user to enter their username and password. <span style="color: red">TO DO - Fill in the rest once the login is done!</span>
