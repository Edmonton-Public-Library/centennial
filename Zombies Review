Zombies Review
==============

Off Campus Map

 - What "advice" is the avatar required to provide? Visual cues? Directional cues? Riddles that help guide the user to the desired building/room?
 - Are all rooms selectable? If not, do there exist visual cues to identify which rooms a user can interact with?
 - How is the zombie placed?
 	- What prevents the user from instantly finding the zombie in the first few rooms they check, and then being done with the game?
 	- Is there a minimum number of "steps" they must navigate through before there is a chance of finding the zombie?

Cross-Platform
==============

- "GPS mode" at the bottom of the document suggests desktop form-factor support. This is not mentioned explicitly elsewhere in the document.
	- Using jQuery will enable general browser support -- but is there going to be a version optimized for keyboard/mouse rather than touch?

- How is Worklight being employed in your software (what does "compiling" convey in the document?) Is browser access on the phones intended? Or is it being compliled down to hybrid/native code?

YouTube Video
=============

- How is the YouTube viewing experience intended (what does "bring the user to a YouTube video" consist of)? Is YouTube being opened up in the browser, or is a video going to be embedded in the software's UI?

Mini Game
=========

- Is there a proposed control scheme that will work with all intended platforms?
- Are these games optional? Will there exist a way to exit the game prior to completing it?
- Can achievements or other details be shared through social networks to encourage word-of-mouth traffic?

GPS
===

- If a user starts the game in GPS mode, can they continue in off-campus mode if they leave the area or turn off GPS during the game?
